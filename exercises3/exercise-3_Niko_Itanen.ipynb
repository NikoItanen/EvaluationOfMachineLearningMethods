    "Complete the tasks given to you in the letter below. In your submission, explain clearly, precisely, and comprehensively why the cross-validation described in the letter failed, what is the correct way to perform cross-validation in the given scenario, and why the correct cross-validation method will give a reliable estimate of the generalisation performance. Then implement the correct cross-validation for the scenario and report its results.\n",

Full points (2p) will be given for a submission that demonstrates a deep understanding of cross-validation on pair-input data and implements the requested cross-validation correctly (incl. reporting the results).

    "Dear Data Scientist,\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a long-term research project regarding a specific set of proteins. I am attempting to discover small organic compounds that can bind strongly to these proteins and thus act as drugs. I have already made laboratory experiments to measure the affinities between some proteins and drug molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "My colleague is working on another set of proteins, and the objectives of his project are similar to mine. He has recently discovered thousands of new potential drug molecules. He asked me if I could find the pairs that have the strongest affinities among his proteins and drug molecules. Obviously I do not have the resources to measure all the possible pairs in my laboratory, so I need to prioritise. I decided to do this with the help of machine learning, but I have encountered a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what I have done so far: First I trained a K-nearest neighbours regressor with the parameter value K=10 using all the 400 measurements I had already made in the laboratory with my proteins and drug molecules. They comprise of 77 target proteins and 59 drug molecules. Then I performed a leave-one-out cross-validation with this same data to estimate the generalisation performance of the model. I used C-index and got a stellar score above 90%. Finally I used the model to predict the affinities of my colleague's proteins and drug molecules. The problem is: when I selected the highest predicted affinities and tried to verify them in the lab, I found that many of them are much lower in reality. My model clearly does not work despite the high cross-validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please explain why my estimation failed and how leave-one-out cross-validation should be performed to get a reliable estimate. Also, implement the correct leave-one-out cross-validation and report its results. I need to know whether it would be a waste of my resources if I were to use my model any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data I used to create my model is available in the files `input.data`, `output.data` and `pairs.data` for you to use. The first file contains the features of the pairs, whereas the second contains their affinities. The third file contains the identifiers of the drug and target molecules of which the pairs are composed. The files are paired, i.e. the i<sup>*th*</sup> row in each file is about the same pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yours sincerely, \\\n",

    "Starting points on where the Bio Scientist have started to work on this task are actually reasonable, but the problem lies in the perfomance estimation. Bio Scientist have used the leave-one-out cross-validation straight without accounting the pairwise depencencies. The issue here arises because we have multiple data points which are sharing the same protein or drug, and eventually leading to information leakage. While we performing basic leave-one-out cross-validation, removing only one pair at time does not prevent the model from seeing highlt similar data points druing training, meaning that we are getting overly optimistic peformance estimations that does not reflect how the model really perform with unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a more reliable perfomance estimation, we want to adjust the validation method by ensuring that all our data pairs whwich are containing the same protein or drug as the test pair are ignored from training. This way, our model is tested on genuinely novel protein-drug combination rather than those it has effectively seeen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the current model overfits by learning patterns too well from the training data, decreasing its ability to generalize an unseen data. [1], [2]\n",

    "### In Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have fixed the problem where performance validation gave an overly optimistic accuracy estimation. Applying all pairwise dependent data points is a really important task, because without it we get overly optimistic results when training the model with them. In reality, the model will not perform as well in real-world applications because it cannot generalize to a single value without dependent pairs at all. We want to make sure that the predictions are actually calculated by using the independent data points for the unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our cross-validation has now been fixed, improvements can still be made. Our C-index is now around 0.581 with a K-value of 10, suggesting that our model performs only slightly better than guessing its values at random. To obtain valuable information, we want to achieve a much higher C-index. This can be corrected by using a more optimal hyperparameter for the k-NN model, such as 10, as we calculated. We also need to use much more data, as we currently have a very limited amount of data available, which can increase the accuracy of the model. Model selection could also be a way to improve these results. For example, using alternative regression models (such as Random Forest or SVR) could improve the prediction accuracy compared to k-NN."
